# 🧠 Celebrity Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building an **image classification model** that can recognize and classify famous **acting personalities** using machine learning techniques.

---

## 🏅 Personalities Covered

The model is trained to identify the following five actors:

- **Timothee Chalamet**
- **Millie Bobby Brown**
- **Tom Holland**
- **Will Smith**
- **Zendaya**

## 📁 Project Structure

- UI : This contains UI website code
- server: Python flask server
- model: Contains python notebook for model building
- images_dataset: Dataset used for our model training

---

## ⚙️ Technologies and Tools Used

- **Python** – Core language for development  
- **NumPy** & **OpenCV** – Data preprocessing and image cleaning  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization and analysis  
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** – Model building and evaluation  
- **Flask** – Backend web framework for serving the model  
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** – Frontend for the user interface  
- **Jupyter Notebook**, **VS Code**, **PyCharm** – IDEs for coding and experimentation

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Image Collection** – Images of the five athletes are gathered using Google Image Scraping scripts.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – The images are cleaned, resized, and processed using OpenCV and NumPy.  
3. **Model Training** – A machine learning model is trained with Scikit-learn to classify the images.  
4. **Model Deployment** – The trained model is deployed using Flask as a backend server.  
5. **User Interface** – The frontend UI allows users to upload an image and see predictions in real time.
